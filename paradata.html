<h2>Paradata document or how I went about the project</h2>

<p>I created the Chaudière Falls Historical Web Map to explore the possibilities of digital mapping technologies in studying the history of the Chaudière Falls. In particular, I am interested in how historical maps and digital mapping tools can be used to tell different kinds of stories about the past and lead to new insights. As my MA research is focused on the history of the Chaudière Falls, I figured that my project for History 5706: Digital History presented the ideal opportunity for me to explore digital mapping tools as a way to enhance my research. I see digital mapping technologies and historical GIS (geographic information systems) as key methodologies that will allow me to explore the kinds of questions that I am interested in related to the history of the Chaudière Falls. My research explores the shifting uses and meanings associated with the falls over time through the theoretical lenses of environmental history, Indigenous history, and settler colonialism. I see digital mapping technologies and historical GIS as essential tools for deepening our understanding of this history.</p>

<p>At the outset of the course, I was drawn to learning how to use GIS software such as ArcGIS or QGIS. However, I soon realized that the learning curve for these programs was too steep for the timeline of this course. I needed to develop some basic expertise in a set of tools and build a prototype by the beginning of December. So from there I shifted my focus to using Google Earth or StoryMaps.js for exploring how the uses of the Chaudière Falls have changed over time. And then I shifted my focus once again after meeting with Dr. Graham. He mentioned Leaflet and a couple of visual storytelling tools (e.g. Mural). I got excited about Leaflet, especially after looking at <a href="http://revolt.axismaps.com/">Vincent Brown's web map of the Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761.</a> I immediately realized the potential of Leaflet for representing the stories that I am interested in telling about the history of the falls. I observed that it would be possible to build a basic web map within a few weeks that I could enhance and build upon over time. At the same time, I knew that I could come back to learning ArcGIS or QGIS at a later time. And I also came to understand that web mapping tools like Leaflet offer a different set of affordances and benefits than GIS software.</p>

<p>There are a few interrelated aims of the Chaudière Falls Historical Web Map:

<ul>

<li><small>To explore my research questions through visual and cartographic methods</small></li>
<li><small>To communicate my research outputs and progress of my research with an academic audience</small></li>
<li><small>To communicate my ressearch outputs and progress of my research with a non-academic audience</small></li>

</ul></p>

<p>I see the web map as an iterative project. What you see right now is a prototype. I will continue revising and updating the web map based on feedback and continued research. In the months ahead, I plan to add descriptive information to the points on each historic map which will help situate the maps within their historic contexts. I also plan to find and georectify more maps. The web map is currently missing maps from between 1926 to 2010. This is a significant gap that perhaps most notably misses the Gréber Report from 1950 which recommended that the islands which make up the Chaudière Falls site be transformed from their industrial uses into parkland. The Gréber Report was also the impetus for the creation of the National Capital Commission. I tried to georectify one of Gréber's sketches, but the orientation and visual features proved too challenging. Surely the web map as it currenty exists includes other gaps in cartographic and visual representations of the falls from 1926 to 2010. Aerial photographs and maps of the falls created from an Indigenous perspective come to mind.</p>

<p>On the subject of Indigenous representations of the falls, this is another significant gap of the Chaudière Falls Historical Web Map for the time being. Based on the time constraints of the course, I drew all except for one of the maps from the online database of Library and Archives Canada (LAC). This was most feasible given my timeframe since LAC has digitized many maps of the falls and most of these are in the public domain. The obvious limitation here is that all of these maps represent the Chaudière Falls from a settler colonial perspective. This is a current limitation of the web map that is well worth reflecting on and rectifying. While the history of human interaction with the falls reaches back milennia, the web map only represents the falls from the nineteenth century onward. This is something that I hope to change going forward.</p>
